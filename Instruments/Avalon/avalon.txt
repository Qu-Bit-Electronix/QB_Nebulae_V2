AVALON - "Morphing Nebulaeum" v1.4, 2-12-2021
-------------------------------------------------
Inspired by the Synthesis Technology Morphing Terrarium E350, Cloud Terrarium E352 and capable of loading samples from the WaveEdit program.
Like the Synthesis Technology Terrarium's and Quad VCO, it can morph a wavetable bank of 64 waves in a 8x8 grid (X and Y) and from wave 1 to 64 (Z).
It is able to read wavetable banks make by the WaveEdit program.

AVALON comes with a custom wavetable bank, but other WaveEdit wavetable banks can be downloaded here, including the original E350 banks called 'Bank A', 'Bank B' and 'Bank C':

-------------------------------------------------
Limitations
-------------------------------------------------
- There is no FM like the original instruments.
- Knobs on the Nebulae are a bit 'quantized', it does not have the morph smoothness like the original instruments.
- Due to some nature of the Nebulae, there is a slight pormatento when playing notes.


-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
Start:        X morph position
Density:      Y morph position
Speed:        Z morph position (coarse morph)

Size Alt:     Z morph position (fine morph range)
Overlap:      Octave up and down volume
Overlap Alt:  Octave up and down volume Mode
Window:       Detune the up and down octave
Window Alt:   Instant detune range
Freeze:       Instant detune
Blend:        Blending between XY and Z. Different Blend modes available.
Blend Alt:    Blend mode. Mode 4 and 5 are 'stereo', see Blend Modes below.
Record:       Waveform Y selection without morphing.
Record Alt:   Waveform X selection without morphing.
Source:       Waveform Z selection without morphing.
File:         Advances to the next wavetable bank file.


-------------------------------------------------
Outputs
-------------------------------------------------
When Blend is Fully CCW:

XY on the Left output. Z on the Right output.
Except Morph mode 4, which starts both Left and Right as XY.

When rotating Blend towards CW, different morphinh applies to Left and Right, see 'Blending and Morph modes'.


-------------------------------------------------
Blending and Morph modes
-------------------------------------------------
Blend:
  The AVALON instrument allows for blending between the XY and Z waves.
  There are 5 different settings; where XY or Z are unchanged, whereas the other channel blends between XY and Z.

Blend Alt:
  1. Full CCW
  Left:  XY ->  XY -> XY    : Untouched: no blending with Z / no detuning
  Right:  Z -> XYZ -> XY    : Blend Z to XYZ to XY
  
  2. 9 o'clock
  Left:  XY -> XYZ -> Z     : Blend XY to XYZ to Z
  Right:  Z ->   Z -> Z     : Untouched: no blending with XY / no detuning
  
  3. 12 o'clock
  Left:  XY -> XYZ          : Blend XY to XYZ
  Right:  Z -> XYZ          : Blend  Z to XYZ
  
  4. 3 o'clock
  Left:  XY -> XYZ ->  Z    : Blend XY to XYZ to  Z
  Right:  Z -> XYZ -> XY    : Blend  Z to XYZ to XY

  5. Full CW
  Left:  XY -> XYZ -> Z     : Blend XY to XYZ to Z
  Right: XY -> XYZ -> Z     : Blend XY to XYZ to Z
  

-------------------------------------------------
Oscilator octave Up / Down volume and Detuning
-------------------------------------------------
'Split' the sound into three oscillators up and one down one octave and detune.
In Morph mode 1 and 2, the 'untouched' morph channel is not detuned.

Overlap:
  Increase the volume of the Up and Down octave oscillators.

  CCW = 0%, CW = 100% volume of the Up and Down oscillators.

Overlap Alt:
  3 volume Modes of the Up and Down oscillators.
  When (Overlap = CW) then volumes compared to 'middle' octave:

  CCW: Up = 150%, Down = 66%
  12h: Up = 100%, Down = 100%
  CW:  Up = 66%,  Down = 150%

Window:
  Increases the detuning from no detuning to one octave up and one octave down.
  There are no tuned (music theory modes) intervals in between...

Window Alt:
  Instant detune range, from 'a fraction' to 'a bit more'.

Freeze:
  Instant detune (no unison at CW or CCW of Overlap).


-------------------------------------------------
XY and Z morphing
-------------------------------------------------
Start and Density:
  Start and Density will morph the waves in a XY grid like fashion.
  The 64 waves from the WaveEdit application are split in an 8 by 8 grid (see 'Grid XY View' in WaveEdit).
  Start morphs the wave in the X direction, while Density morphs in the Y direction.

Speed and Size:
  Speed morphs only in one direction 'Z', from wave 1,2,3 etc to the 64th wave (see 'Waterfall View' in WaveEdit).
  Size is fine morphing. The Speed knob is slightly quantized by nature.

Record:
  When Record is selected, there will be no morphing when 'selecting' the waves on the Y-axis with Density.
  You can choose 'clean' waves from the Y-axis and still morph between the waves in that row when Record Alt is deselected. 
  However, the Blend knob still blends between the XY and Z output. This way you can 'morph' between waves which are not 'neighbours' of each other!

Record Alt:
  When Record Alt is selected (press and hold Source, (de)select Record, release Source), there will be no morphing when 'selecting' the waves on the X-axis with Start.
  You can choose 'clean' waves from the X-axis and still morph between the waves in the Y-axis 'column' when Record is deselected.
  However, the Blend knob still blends between the XY and Z output. This way you can 'morph' between waves which are not 'neighbours' of each other!

Source:
  When Source is selected, there will be no morphing when 'selecting' the waves on the Z-axis with Speed and Size. You can choose 'clean' waves from the Z-axis.
  However, the Blend knob still blends between the XY and Z output. This way you can 'morph' between waves which are not 'neighbours' of each other!


-------------------------------------------------
Z fine morph and morph range
-------------------------------------------------
Size:
  Morphing through Z (64 waves) is not very smooth, as the knob value is a bit 'quantized'.
  The Size knob allows fine tuning of the Z morphing. The Size Alt (Shift/Secondary Size) defines the range of this fine tuning as 'an offset' to the Speed knobs Z morph.
  Size at 12 o'clock mean no -/+ of offset.

Size Alt:
  Full CCW    - 1 wave range,  -/+ 0.5 'wave length' from center.
  9 to 10     - 2 waves range, -/+ 1.0 'wave length' from center.
  12 o'clock  - 4 waves range, -/+ 2.0 'wave length' from center.
  14 to 15    - 6 waves range, -/+ 3.0 'wave length' from center.
  Full CW     - 8 waves range, -/+ 4.0 'wave length' from center. This is equal to the range of X and Y.


-------------------------------------------------
Tips and tricks
-------------------------------------------------

Morph mode 4 and 5 are fun in stereo with modulation of the Blend knob (set to CCW for full modulation, knobs are 'offset' when CV is patched).


Have fun!
